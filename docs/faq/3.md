# 3, Using WSL( Windows Sub Linux ) Docker, when use mode `kubevpn dev`, can not connect to cluster network, how to solve this problem?

Answer:

this is because WSL'Docker using Windows's Network, so if even start a container in WSL, this container will not use WSL
network, but use Windows network

Solution:

- 1): install docker in WSL, not use Windows Docker-desktop
- 2): use command `kubevpn connect` on Windows, and then startup `kubevpn dev` in WSL
- 3): startup a container using command `kubevpn connect` on Windows, and then
  startup `kubevpn dev --network container:$CONTAINER_ID` in WSL
